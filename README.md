# TRAVELIST

TraveList is a travel planning tool that allows users to see information on countries they search for and to save any of those searches in.

We wanted to create a tool that allows for users to get a snapshot view of any country that they were thinking about travelling to.

User Story:

AS a global traveller

I WANT to search for different countries

SO THAT I can see information about countries I can travel to
